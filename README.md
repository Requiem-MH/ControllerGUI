This project was made by Michael Harrop, Jaxton Winder, and Adam Flanders. The library we used to receive controller input was Jamepad(https://github.com/williamahartman/Jamepad).

This is a GUI made using Java 10 with JavaFX. The program reads whether an Xbox One or PS4 controller is being used as input and displays a picture of it. When a button is pressed/control stick moved on the controller, the GUI will highlight the corresponding button/control stick. The trigger buttons will change opacity depending on the extent pressed. The GUI features different highlight colors, as well as an adjustable dead zone slider. When the dead zone slider is used, the control sticks will not highlight on the GUI until pushed passed the current value of the dead zone (which is represented as a gray circle over the control stick).
